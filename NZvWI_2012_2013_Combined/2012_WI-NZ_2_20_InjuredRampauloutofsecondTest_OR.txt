 The fast bowler Ravi Rampaul has been ruled out of the second Test against New Zealand due to a groin injury. He has been replaced in the 13-man West Indies squad by Fidel Edwards, who has been in and out of the Test side this year.

Edwards has a fine record at Sabina Park in Jamaica, where the second Test will start on Thursday; he has taken 25 Test wickets there at an average of 22.28. However, Edwards might yet be left out of the starting line-up if West Indies included Tino Best, who was part of the squad for the first Test.

Rampaul picked up two wickets in each innings of the victory in Antigua, which gave West Indies a 1-0 lead in the two-game series. Kemar Roach and Sunil Narine did most of the damage with the ball in the first Test.

West Indies will be searching for their first series win against New Zealand in 1996 when they take the field in Kingston.

West Indies squad Chris Gayle, Kieran Powell, Adrian Barath, Assad Fudadin, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Marlon Samuels, Narsingh Deonarine, Denesh Ramdin (wk), Darren Sammy (capt), Tino Best, Fidel Edwards, Kemar Roach, Sunil Narine.
